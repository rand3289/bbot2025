# Braker Bot 2025
This is an open source OpenSCAD project for a 3D printed robot leg.    
It operates by delivering power to joints using differentials and spinning disks.  Brakes clamp down on the disks to transfer torque to the joint.  More info is available here: https://hackaday.io/project/171924-braker-one-robot
